    # Building Data Models
    
    This repository is going to be archived (Jan-2020) and subsequent works will be carried out
    in [Smart data models] (https://github.com/smart-data-models) repositories. Further questions 
    on migration. alberto.abella@fiware.org
    
    This folders contains a number of data models related to the modelling of
    Building and its management based on
    [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/) activities. Compared to GSMA
    models, we introduced some changes and removed the `BuildingType` model.
    
    The following entity types are supported:
    
    -   `Building`: A Building is a human build structure where different activities
        occur related to living, working, healing and so on.
    -   `BuildingOperation`: It captures automated operations that may be ongoing
        within a building.

      # Construyendo modelos de datos

      Este repositorio se archivará (enero de 2020) y los trabajos posteriores se llevarán a cabo
      en los repositorios [Modelos de datos inteligentes] (https://github.com/smart-data-models).

      Esta carpeta contiene varios modelos de datos relacionados con el modelado de
      Edificio y su gestión basada en
      [GSMA] (https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/) actividades. En comparación con GSMA
      modelos, introdujimos algunos cambios y eliminamos el modelo `BuildingType`.

        ## Description
  
        This entity contains a harmonised description of a Building. This entity is
        associated with the vertical segments of smart homes, smart cities, industry and
        related IoT applications.
        
        This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
        operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/), compared to
        GSMA data model following changes are introduced:
        
        -   the reference to `BuildingType` is removed, since `BuildingType` compared to
            `category` attribute does not introduce significant information.
        
        -   `category` attribute is required.
        
        -   `openingHours` is introduced following schema.org data model to allow
            fine-grained on building opening times. GSMA supported this as free text in
            the `notes` attribute (removed as well).
        
        -   `refSubscriptionService` is not supported, since `SubscriptionService` model
            is not supported currently.
