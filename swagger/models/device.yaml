    An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a
    particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A Device is
    a tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or
    consumer of data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of
    communicating electronically via a network.

    This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
    operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/).

    This data model reuses concepts coming from the [SAREF
    Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf)

        A observed or reported value. For actuator devices, it is an
        attribute that allows a controlling application to change the
        actuation setting. For instance, a switch device which is currently
        _on_ can report a value `"on"`of type `Text`. Obviously, in order to
        toggle the referred switch, this attribute value will have to be
        changed to `"off"`.
